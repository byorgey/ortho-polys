Some ideas for how to draw OPs.

- Physics-based model.  Angles are rigid, edges are springs that want
  to be 1 unit long?  Find crossings etc. and force things apart, in
  the right direction to get uncrossed.

- Start with valid drawing based on halving etc., then relax subject
  to no crossings.

- Use a SAT solver---encode all the relevant constraints, then let it
  find a satisfying assignment.  Or use ILP solver---since we don't
  just want *satisfying* assignment but we want an optimal one.  Can
  probably find a way to express all constraints in terms of
  inequalities.

- Something else?  Is there an analytic solution?
